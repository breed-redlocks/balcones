INSERT INTO `compliance` VALUES (1,'10','ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE ACT (EEA)','EEA makes the theft or misappropriation of trade secrets a criminal offense. Taking papers from Dumpsters outside offices is called “Dumpster diving” and is a common tactic used by commercial information brokers as well as foreign intelligence services. It involves collecting and going through the trash left out for collection from residences and businesses. Stealing trash is not illegal. The Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that once an item is left for trash pickup, there is no expectation of privacy or continued ownership. Who is affected by EEA: U. S. Citizens, General businesses handling sensitive data in hardcopy format.'),(2,'20','FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT','The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 is also known as the FACT Act, and was signed into law on December 4, 2003. In general, the Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”). The Act contains a number of provisions intended to combat consumer fraud and related crimes, including identity theft, and to assist its victims. Specifically the act requires the destruction of papers containing consumer information. It is hard to imagine any business or organization that is not bound by this law.'),(3,'30','GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT','The GLB act of 1999 mandates that financial institutions that obtain nonpublic personal information through the normal course of their business must develop precautions to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records. This includes secure storage, disposal, and sharing of confidential information. Who must comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: Banking and credit issuing, insurance, stocks, bonds, and investing, financial service providers.'),(4,'40','HIPAA','The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 regulates the healthcare industry in the United States and assures that healthcare organizations will be responsible for the secure electronic transmission, secure storage and disposal of patient information. The most efficient means of disposal is complete obliteration that only comes with high-grade, third-party shredding.'),(5,'50','2009 HITECH ACT','A recent addition to HIPAA – the 2009 HITECH Act – requires another layer of business scrutiny. The HITECH Act requires affected institutions to alert compromised individuals and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information. The regulation defines \"unsecured\" as health information as that which is not secured by use of technology or methodology to render it unusable, unreadable, or undecipherable to unauthorized viewers.'),(6,'60','THE RED FLAGS RULE ','Although enacted in 2008, the rule has been revised and the compliance finish line has been moved. The current finish line is June 1, 2010. The Red Flags Rule is a U.S. federal law that requires most every business and organization to develop and implement an identity theft prevention program. Authentication is required when a new financial or credit account is opened or when a change is requested on an existing covered account. The law covers consumer and business accounts. Because of the broad definitions of “covered account” and “creditor,” most businesses and organizations accept payment for products or services after they are delivered is a creditor under the law and must comply. This rule affects businesses within the healthcare, financial, utility, telecom, mortgage, auto dealerships and more. Those that only accept payment prior to or upon delivery are not creditors regardless of how payment is accepted—cash, check or credit card.'),(7,'70','SARBANES–OXLEY ACT ','The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 also known as SOX. The bill was enacted as a reaction to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals, which cost investors billions of dollars when the share prices of affected companies collapsed and shook public confidence in the nation’s securities markets. The legislation set new or enhanced standards for all U.S. public company boards, management and public accounting firms. It does not apply to privately held companies. This is related to shredding in terms of records retention and the mandate to retain financial documents for at least five years past an audit or review prior to destruction.'),(8,'80','TEXAS BILL 698 ','The Texas Information Disposal Act, House Bill 698 (HB 698), amends the Texas Business and Commerce Code adding document retention and disposal requirements. Specifically, it requires that business records containing “personal identifying information” must be shredded, erased or destroyed by other means prior to disposal. The Act took effect September 7, 2005. It applies to any & all Texas businesses that collect personal identifying information, whether it is from employees or consumers. The Act applies to all business records created before, on or after the date, which the Act took, effect. The Texas Information Disposal Act addresses the final stage of the Records and Information Management (RIM) process…destruction. The Act is to ensure that any and all information that could be used to commit Identity Theft, including Social Security numbers, other government issued identification numbers, financial account numbers (credit card numbers, checking account numbers, etc.), birth-dates and email addresses are securely destroyed.');

There is a question – whether I can entrust casino real money.\r\nI have heard that there are some diplomas documents which special commissions on supervising internet gambling give to casinos.\r\nI am curious I wonder - where it is possible to look at them and what their form is in general. \r\nAlso I have seen in some casinos an option trick - «honesty control» - there are some figures and letters in the window, I can not understand what it can mean how much I can trust it.\r\nThen, if to transfer  the hit jackpot  on electronic wallet - who will pay the commission to Webmoney system?\r\nAnd, at last, the main thing is why do we need bonuses if they are necessary to be won back in a real form, which exceeds the bonus sum by 20-30 times? That is, to receive $1 from the casino I am lucky to get I should risk $30? Can it be profitable?\r\nI am thankful in advance  thanks in advance for any advice and answers to the above-mentioned questions. \r\n[url=http://redhatcasino.com/]Casino Blog[/url]'),(365,'94.142.134.144','05','suspicious zip, suspicious phone, short phone, isNotTX','2010-11-11 18:59:33','google','123456','Syncnemoboype','123456','fwevrty@mailnah.co.cc','[url=http://trig.com/baandoldederd1980/biography]kamagra lovegra apcalis jelly stud 100[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122856937]generic viagra cheapest[/url]\r\n[url=http://trig.com/gumorakors1984/biography]hair transplants propecia[/url]\r\n[url=http://trig.com/depphopecma1978/biography]kamagra oral jelly ajanta pharma limited[/url]\r\n'),(366,'94.142.134.144','05','suspicious zip, suspicious phone, short phone, isNotTX','2010-11-12 11:02:46','google','123456','EnhatteGoonge','123456','aseedftw@mailnah.co.cc','[url=http://trig.com/reiperheawer1984/biography]generic viagra kamagra caverta pillshoprxcom[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122855180]but zithromax online without a prescription[/url]\r\n[url=http://trig.com/ebobpresro1975/biography]lasix side effects in animals[/url]\r\n[url=http://trig.com/riloumito1973/biography]levitra vs cialis review[/url]\r\n'),(367,'188.92.74.40','22','suspicious zip, suspicious phone, short phone, isNotTX','2010-11-12 12:11:29','google','123456','moxyTrerder','123456','dascerjy@huyita.co.cc','[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122861678]bayer levitra online[/url]\r\n[url=http://trig.com/recgekanri1974/biography]kamagra lovegra apcalis jelly stud 100[/url]\r\n[url=http://trig.com/byoknowtadesp1983/biography]renal scan with lasix[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122863651]1cheap cialis online[/url]\r\n'),(368,'94.142.134.144','05','suspicious zip, suspicious phone, short phone, isNotTX','2010-11-13 02:18:45','google','123456','botofferm','123456','sdgvgyed@mailnah.co.cc','[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122854545]edinburgh viagra pages search find[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122865078]viagra and mexico[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122865105]buy kamagra lovegra uk paypal[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122856951]generic viagra master card payment[/url]\r\n'),(369,'188.92.74.40','22','suspicious zip, suspicious phone, short phone, isNotTX','2010-11-13 14:54:46','google','123456','GroomaZoosoxy','123456','veherdas@huyita.co.cc','[url=http://trig.com/selatloding1985/biography]hair loss propecia womens[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122865009]asia kamagra supplier[/url]\r\n[url=http://trig.com/senetdicom1970/biography]zithromax no doctor prescription[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122856896]buying propecia in japan[/url]\r\n'),(370,'94.142.134.144','05','suspicious zip, suspicious phone, short phone, isNotTX','2010-11-13 16:51:44','google','123456','verveDadodeMs','123456','defuiore@mailnah.co.cc','[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122864563]cancer propecia prostate[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122857068]zithromax austria[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122864892]does kamagra work[/url]\r\n[url=http://trig.com/puplasissa1979/biography]cialis mfg[/url]\r\n'),(371,'188.92.74.40','22','suspicious zip, suspicious phone, short phone, isNotTX','2010-11-14 15:46:21','google','123456','Foevomsphohof','123456','genuoeps@huyita.co.cc','[url=http://trig.com/nibesbackte1981/biography]indications for zithromax[/url]\r\n[url=http://trig.com/gewulyre1977/biography]experiences with lasix vision institute[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122853368]levitra play of the year[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122860855]kamagra buyers[/url]\r\n'),(372,'94.142.134.144','05','suspicious zip, suspicious phone, short phone, isNotTX','2010-11-14 15:56:56','google','123456','CizLinaKiva','123456','dascrsi@mailnah.co.cc','[url=http://trig.com/paystariner1974/biography]oral kamagra[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122854406]effects of levitra on women[/url]\r\n[url=http://profiles.friendster.com/122863389]order levitra online[/url]\r\n[url=http://trig.com/berkfornatu1974/biography]zithromax bulletins[/url]\r\n'),(373,'71.42.139.47','TX','','2010-11-15 15:49:40','The Law Office of Gregory Hitt','78701','Amelia','(512) 322-0118','ak.lawoffice100@gmail.com','small law firm needs shredding service with best price quote;

It hurts! I know, as many of our clients have shared this frustration when I first talked to them about how to drive more quality prospects to their sites - without having to constantly pay for every click.\r\n\r\nI thought you might like to know some of the reasons why you are not getting more organic (FREE) search engine traffic for Dallasshred.com\r\n\r\n1.Your home page rank is 0, this can be improved further.\r\n\r\n2.Your title is 88% relevant. This can be improved for higher Google ranking.\r\n\r\n3.Your SEO score is 76% This can be improved as implementing on and off-page factors will fetch better results in major search engines.\r\n\r\nIf you can stomach more bad news about what your site needs and are curious to know what our working together would involve then I would be glad to provide you with further detailed analysis in the form of a SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO) SITE REPORT - FREE OF CHARGE. I would first need to know that you are serious about using our services, as the report would involve several hours of our research.\r\n\r\nTo brief you about the company, we are a SEO Company with a worldwide customer base. A team of over 700 SEO specialists in USA and India, serving a vast portfolio of clients who have transformed their businesses by just opting for our services.Thus, we would like to talk with you about how you should be winning new business from the search engines without paying advertisers over and over again for it.\r\n\r\nSEO is not instantaneous, it is not free but it is the only sensible internet marketing choice.Your return on investment (ROI) after 6 months of SEO will be at least 3 times that of paid advertisements and many times greater than our cost. In fact, we guarantee that in the first month of our work, you will see an improvement in ranking, link popularity and traffic or we\'ll work for free until you do! Our clients consistently tell us that their customers find them because they are at the top in Google. Being on the top left of Google (#1- #5 Organic positions) is the best thing you can do for your company\'s website traffic and online reputation.\r\n\r\nIronically,it\'s very likely that you spent your last 6 months of online marketing in dollars on SEO instead of paid advertising that you would have 3 times or greater traffic than today and not need the paid advertising at all.\r\n\r\nFortunately, you can still start today and begin getting that traffic in just a few weeks.We look forward to discuss our SEO plans with you.\r\n\r\nSounds interesting? Feel free to email us or alternatively you can provide your best time and phone number to call you.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nSan\r\n209 6833 433\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPS1: This is one time email and we won’t contact you if you don’t respond to this email.You may also ask us for “REMOVE”.\r\nPS2: We found your site from online advertisements but did not click the Ad to visit.\r\nPS3: We work 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. So we will send more details on “our company profile”, “client references”, “case studies”, “why you should choose us?”, “price list”, “guarantee” etc. upon getting positive response from you.'),(406,'80.67.13.217','26','suspicious zip, suspicious phone, short phone, isNotTX','2010-12-15 03:04:24','google','123456','XXX Tube','123456','nmbvnmbvnbvnbv@yahoo.co.uk','IBN I  <A HREF=\"HTTP://WWW.JIMSPORNLIST.COM\">XXX TUBE</A> ZEX PORN  A MJK EOGJQH|JCL ZIMDCPR V TH TI'),(407,'71.114.237.89','TX','','2010-12-15 18:32:41','Lovelace Law Firm','78620','Mary','5128580707','emllftt@aol.com','We are already a customer.

Tell me please is it real?     \r\n        \r\nSometimes the problem of the extension of a business is getting  vital for each partnership.        \r\nQuite often it happens that firm provides amazing service, it has well organized customer support, but, unfortunately, all neighbor cities already have bought your wares and sales falls down terribly.        \r\nNow and then such condition becomes a reason of the failure of really good companies.        \r\nWhat to do in order to recover from this kind of situation with interest?        \r\n        \r\nThere is a possibility to expand marketing section which will slightly increase recurrent sales.        \r\nIt is also possible to invest into the commercial. And this is very important section of the costs and income.        \r\nBeside this it is real to obtain an office space in adjacent cities or even countries and start to extend instead of crashing.        \r\n        \r\nBut it is also not that easy as we wish it to be. Office space in the surrounding city is expensive. What is more there are additional expenses for the recruitment and educating of the new assistants.        \r\n        \r\nThere is simple solution for such situation that is mentioned below.        \r\n        \r\nRead the story and get the idea of it.        \r\n        \r\nThere was a regular factory in the poky hole of a place, that created reinforced-plastic windows.        \r\nAt the start everything was really great: skilled workers were recruited, that did not claim huge pay, and the quality of the goods was really high. The factory had many contracts, number of which even exceeded productive capacity of the factory.        \r\n        \r\nHolders of the company had decided that it would be the same for a long time, so they made a loan in order to buy new production. It has became even better, but suddenly in half of year or so, the profit decreased.        \r\nFor some reason decreased - and that was it.        \r\nHow could it happen? Why could it happened? Where were the orders?        \r\n        \r\nBut what did the firm do?        \r\nAt the start they had two sale managers that answered the phone and transferred the orders to the factory.        \r\nLater on in terms of the crisis firm has recruited commercial agents as they thought that the orders were much more important then the rest.        \r\nThe agents started to visit house holders and companies and to offer the production of the company. The company even has payed for the advertisement, but all together increased sales just for 20 percent which were not enough even to cover loan. Because there was no market anymore - the whole city has purchased their goods and the firm had no one left to buy their goods.         \r\n        \r\nSomehow company has been stretching out for a half of year more. They replaced everything they could with their goods. They had full monopoly, but not the sales.        \r\nIn the terns of shutdown, workers started to leave.        \r\n        \r\nKeepers decided to sell out the company, as it was better to sell out it now and to return at least part of the money.        \r\nThey published add in newspapers and magazines about selling and even invited few clients to take a look at the factory.        \r\nBut as there was not market for their goods they did not succeed.        \r\nThey attempted to publish advertisement in adjoining cities, but local citizens did not want to buy goods from outsiders.        \r\nJust in the central city of the region there was normal level of sales, but to purchase office there was not possible because of the shortage of the money.	         \r\nAnother problem was that the potential clients did not want to dial inter-city numbers and to pay for roaming as well as to go to another city to buy anything.        \r\n        \r\nTime passed by and formerly the most successful business in the region was crashing.        \r\n        \r\nAnd then the nephew came to visit the owner of the factory. He came to have fun and to take some relaxation. As all people of his age, he seriously loved to wave Internet, and the first thing he asked about was the opportunity to find social network. It turned out that the hosts almost did not use the Internet, so the poor youngster had to use Internet from his mobile device.        \r\nAs the nephew already has visited the factory around a year ago and liked it a lot - he asked for the potentiality to take a look at the works once again. But unexpectedly he received polite breakdown. The guy was impudent and cheerful, so he dared to find out what had happened.        \r\nAnd went to the factory by himself. That evening there was a care-taker who remembered that the nephew was allowed to go into the factory without additional permission of the holders. So he entered the enterprise without any problem.        \r\n        \r\nThe youngster came back home in shock and immediately started to ask questions: \"Why could it happened?\" e.t.c.        \r\nAt the end he was told the truth.        \r\nThe guy got sad and asked for the opportunity to talk with the sales department..        \r\nOwner decided not to murmur and gave to his nephew such opportunity:        \r\n- Do whatever you want, and if you need some help - let me know.        \r\n        \r\nThe youngster pondered for a while and offered to buy office in the capital as it is best place for sales with huge sales area. And after he was explained that there is some shortage of money, he had to implement creatively different way of thinking.        \r\n        \r\nAs usual in such cases he started to wave Google to find the solution.        \r\nAs it was expected Google was some help. In a few minutes of the searching the link to the site that sells telephone numbers anywhere in the world was found. It was a savior!        \r\nIt turned out, that it is possible not to purchase office space in the capital but to purchase the number of the city needed. And just to pretend your physical presence there. Local customers will dial local number and like the result to be connected with the office that is located thousands and thousands miles away.        \r\nThis kind of a telephone number costs nothing in comparison with the price for office rent or purchase, but it is as effective as office. All incoming calls diverts to the number needed, and therefore there is no need to recruit additional workers and to waste money for the office space.        \r\n        \r\nThe firm decided to try this method. The free test of the number was ordered. The connection turned out to be simply great -  clear and distinct, with no creaks and lags. The virtual number was obtained for one month. And unexpectedly they got impressive result. There were so many orders that they had to invite back all the employees and to add another shift.        \r\n        \r\nJust in one year owners covered all their loans and even opened additional business. And the keys to the success were direct numbers and virtual office.'),(613,'97.79.213.110','TX','','2011-04-15 13:34:11','Web Stores America','78758','Mike McManus','512-600-6936','mmcmanus@wsamerica.com','We currently have 2 boxes set up in the office from Iron Mountain that pick up monthly and we\'re looking for better pricing.'),(614,'71.40.235.30','TX','','2011-04-15 15:47:34','PHCC','78610','Samantha Grant','512-523-8094','samantha@phcc-tx.org','Hi! \r\n\r\nWe are needing a price quote on shredding out old textbooks.

For many Balcones Shred customers, shredding is about more than waste management and peace of mind, it is a matter of legal compliance. \r\n\r\nCompliance is necessary because Identity theft has reached epidemic proportions as the Federal Trade Commission estimates nine million American have been affected. \r\n\r\n<object style=\"height: 273px; width: 448px\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/v26jv2IA1GY?version=3\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/v26jv2IA1GY?version=3\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" width=\"448\" height=\"273\"></object>\r\n\r\nIn the interest of education and brevity, Balcones Shred has pulled together a list of eight essential laws tied to shredding: The Economic Espionage Act (EEA), FACTA, Gramm Leach Bliley Act, HIPAA HITECH ACT, Red Flags Rule, SOX and Texas Shred Law 698. This is just a snapshot of what is required by law to protect your business, employees, customers and business partners. \r\n\r\nh2. Economic Espionage Act (EEA)\r\n\r\nEEA makes the theft or misappropriation of trade secrets a criminal offense. Taking papers from dumpsters outside offices is called “dumpster diving” and is a common tactic used by commercial information brokers as well as foreign intelligence services. It involves collecting and going through the trash left out for collection from residences and businesses. Stealing trash is not illegal. The Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that once an item is left for trash pickup, there is no expectation of privacy or continued ownership. Who is affected by EEA: U. S. Citizens and General businesses handling sensitive data in hardcopy format.\r\n\r\nh2. Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act\r\n\r\nThe Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 is also known as the FACT Act, and was signed into law on December 4, 2003. In general, the Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”). The Act contains a number of provisions intended to combat consumer fraud and related crimes, including identity theft. Specifically the act requires the destruction of papers containing consumer information. It is hard to imagine any business or organization that is not bound by this law.\r\n\r\nh2. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\r\n\r\nThe GLB act of 1999 mandates that financial institutions that obtain nonpublic personal information through the normal course of their business must develop precautions to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records. This includes secure storage, disposal, and sharing of confidential information. Who must comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: Banking and credit issuing, insurance, stocks, bonds, and investing, financial service providers.\r\n\r\nh2. 2009 HITECH Act\r\n\r\nA recent addition to HIPAA – the 2009 HITECH Act – requires another layer of business scrutiny. The HITECH Act requires affected institutions to alert compromised individuals and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information. The regulation defines unsecured as health information as that which is not secured by use of technology or methodology to render it unusable, unreadable, or undecipherable to unauthorized viewers.\r\n\r\nh2. The Red Flags Rule \r\n\r\nAlthough enacted in 2008, the rule has been revised and the compliance finish line has been moved. The current finish line is January 1, 2011. The Red Flags Rule is a U.S. federal law that requires most businesses and organization to develop and implement an identity theft prevention program. Authentication is required when a new financial or credit account is opened or when a change is requested on an existing covered account. The law covers consumer and business accounts. Because of the broad definitions of “covered account” and “creditor,” most businesses and organizations accept payment for products or services after they are delivered is a creditor under the law and must comply. This rule affects businesses within the healthcare, financial, utility, telecom, mortgage, auto dealerships and more. Those that only accept payment prior to or upon delivery are not creditors regardless of how payment is accepted—cash, check or credit card.\r\n\r\nh2. Sarbanes–Oxley Act\r\n\r\nThe Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 also known as SOX. The bill was enacted as a reaction to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals, which cost investors billions of dollars when the share prices of affected companies collapsed and shook public confidence in the nation\'s securities markets. The legislation set new or enhanced standards for all U.S. public company boards, management and public accounting firms. It does not apply to privately held companies. This is related to shredding in terms of records retention and the mandate to retain financial documents for at least five years past an audit or review prior to destruction. \r\n\r\nh2. Texas Shred Law 698\r\n\r\nThe Texas Information Disposal Act, House Bill 698 (HB 698), amends the Texas Business and Commerce Code adding document retention and disposal requirements. Specifically, it requires that business records containing “personal identifying information” must be shredded, erased or destroyed by other means prior to disposal. The Act took effect September 7, 2005. It applies to any and all Texas businesses that collect personal identifying information, whether it is from employees or consumers. The Act applies to all business records created before, on or after the date, which the Act took effect. The Texas Information Disposal Act addresses the final stage of the Records and Information Management (RIM) process…destruction. The Act is to ensure that any and all information that could be used to commit Identity Theft, including Social Security numbers, other government issued identification numbers, financial account numbers (credit card numbers, checking account numbers, etc.), birth-dates and email addresses are securely destroyed.',''),(3,0,'','Your Team','Balcones Shred | Document Destruction Dallas, Secure Shredding Austin, Paper Shredder DFW','Document destruction Dallas, document destruction Austin, Paper shredding DFW, off-site shredding dallas, Paper shredding Austin, commercial recycling Austin, secure shredding austin, certificate of destruction dallas','Balcones is a shredding company that provides a unique kind of document destruction.

If you are visiting this site, you already suspect it’s best to retain a reputable third party shredder to securely destroy confidential materials.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for more pros for your pros and cons list, this is the section for you to review closely. If you question whether or not your company can afford professional shredding, just consider the following numbers:\r\n\r\nh3. 1.) If you are a small business, your monthly shredding expenditure might be as little as $35 to $90 or less than your monthly copier or laser printer paper costs.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a medium-sized business, you’re likely to spend between $90 and $200 which is probably less than your monthly T1 phone and Internet service. Large companies will definitely spend more on security personnel and systems than secured shredding which is equally important.\r\n\r\nh3. 2) Buying a new, ill-equipped desk-side shredder for business use will produce paper shreds that can be reattached with just a few minutes of determination on the part of an identity thief or corporate spy.\r\n\r\nYou may be saying to yourself, I know better than to buy a personal shredder for the quantity of documentation our company generates so we’re considering purchasing an industrial shredder. However, industrial in-house shredders, priced anywhere from $12,000 to $25,000, are in need of a three by four footprint all the way around and a dedicated employee to feed them. Additionally, maintenance, the cost to run the machinery, the space, the noise, purchasing of shred containers, and the liability may be expenses you did not originally consider.\r\n\r\nh3. 3) Companies who have taken the in-house shredding approach can probably attest to the wasteful strain of paying a full-time, benefited employee on the books for $28,000 to $40,000 annually to sit for hours shredding documentation.\r\n\r\nThis not only begs the question of financial responsibility but also how comfortable is that employee with personally carrying the federal and state burden of compliance for your company?\r\n\r\nh3. 4) The price of noncompliance can pile up based on the number of legislative violations broken.\r\n\r\nIf even one record is compromised, the fine can be as steep as $50,000. Balcones Shred is acutely aware of recent legislature such as The Red Flags Rule, FACTA, Gramm-Leech-Bliley Act, HIPAA , and Sarbanes – Oxely Act. All these laws protect Texans from one of the nation’s fastest growing crimes – identity theft. Balcones Shred is uniquely qualified to assist you in the compliance of the latest stringent guidelines for confidential data destruction. In addition to protecting consumers, these laws are also designed to protect businesses from losing millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nh3. 5) The negative advertising value for your business’ reputation if a customer’s identity is compromised due to your company’s lack of a certified document destruction plan can be anywhere from $1,000 upwards to $10,000.\r\n\r\nThose costs are only the basic costs associated with a negative online review or blog posting not to mention if the grievance was big enough to make the local nightly news or city newspaper. Balcones Shred conducts security audits that help businesses of all sizes develop destruction plans that help ward off situations that could result in negative publicity.\r\n\r\nh3. 6) Bottom-line, your business needs a great deal of liability insurance to withstand legal and legislative costs tied to mistakes pertaining to incorrectly destroyed documents.\r\n\r\nThis is our business. Balcones Shred comes to every job backed by $10 million in liability insurance. Look behind that insurance level, and you’ll also find NAID certification. \r\n',''),(9,0,'','Why Shred','Balcones Shred | Paper Shredding Austin, Secure Shredding Dallas, Confidential Shredding DFW','Paper Shredding Austin, Secure Shredding Dallas, Confidential Shredding DFW, paper shredding fort worth, secure shredding austin, document destruction austin, document destruction dallas','Staying green & compliant with Texas laws is a great reason for Austin & DFW companies to begin shredding.

To Protect Against Identity Theft\r\n\r\n!(right)/rsrc/whyshred/containers_small2.gif! According to the Federal Trade Commission, as many as nine million Americans have their identities stolen each year. Current FBI estimates find identity theft is costing American businesses and consumers $50 billion annually. When you consider the \"cost of professional shredding\":/budget.php against the cost of not shredding, the math will always lead back to third-party shredding. \r\n\r\nh2. To Obey Laws Mandating Shredding\r\n\r\nIn addition to the cost of rebuilding credit and reputation related to identity theft, there is also the pressing consideration of legal exposure to your company. More than 40 federal laws mandate that all businesses, healthcare facilities and financial institutions protect the confidential information of their clientele. All of these laws to some degree require secure document destruction that only high-grade, third party shredders such as Balcones Shred can offer. We implore you to learn more about the \"legal compliance\":/compliance.php of shredding.  \r\n\r\nh2. To Preserve Customer, Client and Patient Privacy\r\n\r\nWhether you are a two-person shop or a company known worldwide, you have confidential customer information within your possession. Today’s customer or patient comes to you for your expertise and has an unspoken expectation that you are protecting their privacy behind the scenes. Failure to do so can expose you to bad publicity, poor word of mouth and potentially lost business. Balcones Shred knows the ins and outs of all current privacy legislation including but not limited to FACTA, HIPAA, Hi-tech HIPAA, GLB, Red Flag Rules, SOX and Texas Bill 698. \r\n\r\nh2. To Shield Sensitive Company Information\r\n\r\nBeyond identity theft, there is also the threat of corporate competitors interested in the details of your confidential business papers.

Balcones Shred provides electronic waste recycling in line with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s guidelines. Electronic waste or E-waste, as it is commonly known, is the name for electronic products nearing the end of their \"useful life.\" Computers, copiers, digital cameras, fax machines and phones are the most common business types of e-waste. Household e-waste includes televisions, VCRs and stereos. \r\n\r\nThe nonprofit Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition reports that 70 percent of the heavy metals in the nation’s landfills are from electronics. Nearly 2 in 10 consumers that disposed of a desktop computer, monitor or cell phone in the past year threw them in the trash. Fourteen percent of those that disposed of a laptop computer last year threw it in the trash. The EPA reports that Americans trash two million tons of unwanted electronics each year, which represents six times the amount they recycle. All of this E-waste being inappropriately disposed of has the potential to leak hazardous substances such as lead, cadmium, beryllium and other contaminants into surrounding ecosystems. \r\n\r\nMany electronic products can be reused, refurbished or recycled but most users do not know how. In fact, E-waste is one of the fastest growing segments of our nation\'s waste stream. Certain components of some electronic products contain materials that render them hazardous, depending on their condition and density. For this reason, Balcones Shred urges all businesses to seek out our services for the proper and compliant method for E-waste destruction and recycling.

Why do I need to shred my documents?\r\n\r\nReason #1: \r\nFirst of all, It Is the law. Secondly, it is essential for your company to protect its interests.\r\n\r\nReason #2: \r\nSome organizations are required to destroy certain kinds of information. Currently, healthcare and financial services companies are mandated to comply with certain regulations set forth by HIPAA andFACTA. If ignored, organizations can face stiff financial penalties and hinder their reputation. Since September 2005, Texas House Bill No. 698 went into effect “relating to the disposal of certain business records that contain personal identifying information; providing a civil penalty.”\r\n\r\nReason #3: \r\nYour employees have a legal right to the protection of their personal information. Any information with regard to health insurance, payroll, applications and résumés should be protected.\r\n\r\nReason #4: \r\nYour customers entrust you with important information, and it is your company’s responsibility to protect their privacy and identity.\r\n\r\n\r\nReason #5:\r\nBy discarding sensitive information in a sloppy way, you surrender ownership of that information. Shredding is the only way to make sure sensitive information is destroyed while you still maintain control of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. What is Sarbanes Oxley?\r\n\r\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, also known as the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002 and commonly called SOx or SarbOx, is a federal law passed in response to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals. These scandals resulted in a decline of public trust in accounting and reporting practices. The legislation is wide ranging and establishes new or enhanced standards for all U.S. public company Boards, Management and public accounting firms. The Act covers issues such as auditor independence, corporate governance and enhanced financial disclosure.\r\n\r\nAmong the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s major provisions in one that includes a requirement that public companies evaluate and disclose the effectiveness of their internal controls. This particular requirement emphasizes the need for companies to have detailed information control systems – including secure disposal of obsolete business records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. What is HIPAA?\r\n\r\n“HIPAA” or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, establishes national standards to protect individuals’ medical records and other personal health information.\r\n\r\n* It gives patients more control over their health information.\r\n* It sets boundaries on the use and release of health records.\r\n* It establishes appropriate safeguards that health care providers and others must achieve to protect the privacy of health information.\r\n* It holds violators accountable, with civil and criminal penalties that can be imposed if they violate patients’ privacy rights.\r\n* It strikes a balance when public responsibility supports disclosure of some forms of data – for example, to protect public health.\r\n* For patients – it means being able to make informed choices when seeking care and reimbursement for care based on how personal health information may be used.\r\n\r\n* It enables patients to find out how their information may be used, and about certain disclosures of their information that have been made.\r\n* It generally limits release of information to the minimum reasonably needed for the purpose of the disclosure.\r\n* It generally gives patients the right to examine and obtain a copy of their own health records and request corrections.\r\n* It empowers individuals to control certain uses and disclosures of their health information.\r\n\r\nFor more information about HIPPA\'s specific requirements for the average health care provider, visit the privacy plan\'s <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">site</a>.  \r\n\r\n\r\nh2. What is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act?\r\n\r\nThe Financial Modernization Act of 1999, also known as the “Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act” or GLB Act, includes provisions to protect consumers’ personal financial information held by financial institutions. There are three principal parts to the privacy requirements: the Financial Privacy Rule, Safeguards Rule and Pretexting provisions.\r\nThe GLB Act gives authority to eight federal agencies and each state to administer and enforce the Financial Privacy Rule and the Safeguards Rule. These two regulations apply to “financial institutions,” which include not only banks, securities firms, and insurance companies, but also companies providing various types of financial products and services to consumers. Among these services are lending, brokering or servicing any type of consumer loan, transferring or safeguarding money, preparing individual tax returns, providing financial advice or credit counseling, providing residential real estate settlement services, collecting consumer debts and an array of other activities. These non-traditional “financial institutions” are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Financial Privacy Rule governs the collection and disclosure of customers’ personal financial information by financial institutions. It also applies to companies, whether or not they are financial institutions, who receive such information.\r\n\r\nThe Safeguards Rule requires all financial institutions to design, implement and maintain safeguards to protect customer information. The Safeguards Rule applies not only to financial institutions that collect information from their own customers, but also to financial institutions “such as credit reporting agencies” that receive customer information from other financial institutions.\r\n\r\nThe Pretexting provisions of the GLB Act protect consumers from individuals and companies that obtain their personal financial information under false pretenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Does my state have specific requirements?\r\n\r\nAn increasing number of States and even individual cities have specific privacy legislation to protect consumers. Some of these laws specifically address privacy; others are incorporated into Deceptive Trade Practice or Credit Reporting laws. Most of this legislation requires recipients of “personal identifying information”, like Social Security Numbers, telephones numbers, names, and addresses, or some combination of that information to safeguard that information and properly dispose of it when it is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nWhile you should consult your local legal advisor on your specific requirements, it is a safe bet that some aspect of your business is affected by one privacy law or another that will necessitate shredding your end-of-life business records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. What types of document destruction services are there?\r\n\r\nDocument destruction services fall into two broad categories: “On-Site” and “Off-Site.\" These services are performed by companies ranging from the independent entrepreneur providing local service with a single truck or to large corporations with national capabilities and related services like document storage and imaging.\r\n\r\nThe type of service and company that you choose should relate to the volume of documents you have to destroy, the frequency you need service, your security policies, the flexibility and reputation of the service provider and lastly your budget. For example, very large volume purges and mixed media, like plastics, pharmaceutical bottles, and computer hard drives, don’t lend themselves well to on-site service. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. What is on-site shredding?\r\n\r\nOn-site shredding involves performing destruction services at your location in your parking lot or loading dock area. It is most frequently done with large box type trucks that contain a shredder and a mechanism for lifting a container filled with documents up into the shredding unit. These trucks make multiple stops and can typically process 10 – 20 containers an hour. Some small operations may use enclosed trailers containing a shredder instead of a dedicated truck.\r\n\r\nOn-site shredding is advantageous when you must personally witness the destruction of your documents on a regular basis. There is also no risk that whole documents might be released into the open if the truck is involved in a significant accident.\r\n\r\nDrawbacks include a potentially higher cost for the service, noise and congestion in the operating area, risk of losing documents as they are being loaded into the shred truck, and depending on the service provider, reliance on a single specialized and complicated piece of equipment. On-site shredding is also less environmentally friendly because of the extra fuel used and emissions generated by the truck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. What is off-site shredding?\r\n\r\nOff-site shredding involves transporting containers from your facility to a central shredding location. Containers are typically transported in locked vans, box trucks or even tractor trailers depending on the volume. A large off-site operation might be capable of shredding 5 to 15 tons of material an hour or twice to ten times the capability of an on-site truck.\r\n\r\nOff-site shredding is advantageous when you have a large volume of documents to be destroyed. The most common reasons for off-site shredding include: cleaning out many years of old files, if you have a large number of employees in a campus setting, or if your business is printing/processing intensive. Off-site shredding is significantly more efficient than on-site shredding because the equipment is faster and can operate continuously. Because off-site shredding is electrically powered, it makes less of an environmental impact than on-site shredding.\r\n\r\nDue to liability issues, you are not allowed to witness off-site destruction. There is also some small risk of documents being released into the open if the transport vehicle is involved in an accident between your facility and the shredding plant. ','Full Content');

For many Balcones Shred customers, shredding is about more than waste management and peace of mind, it is a matter of legal compliance. \r\n\r\nCompliance is necessary because Identity theft has reached epidemic proportions as the Federal Trade Commission estimates nine million American have been affected. \r\n\r\nIn the interest of education and brevity, Balcones Shred has pulled together a list of eight essential laws tied to shredding: The Economic Espionage Act (EEA), FACTA, Gramm Leach Bliley Act, HIPAA HITECH ACT, Red Flags Rule, SOX and Texas Shred Law 698. This is just a snapshot of what is required by law to protect your business, employees, customers and business partners. \r\n\r\nh2. Economic Espionage Act (EEA)\r\n\r\nEEA makes the theft or misappropriation of trade secrets a criminal offense. Taking papers from dumpsters outside offices is called “dumpster diving” and is a common tactic used by commercial information brokers as well as foreign intelligence services. It involves collecting and going through the trash left out for collection from residences and businesses. Stealing trash is not illegal. The Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that once an item is left for trash pickup, there is no expectation of privacy or continued ownership. Who is affected by EEA: U. S. Citizens and General businesses handling sensitive data in hardcopy format.\r\n\r\nh2. Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act\r\n\r\nThe Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 is also known as the FACT Act, and was signed into law on December 4, 2003. In general, the Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”). The Act contains a number of provisions intended to combat consumer fraud and related crimes, including identity theft. Specifically the act requires the destruction of papers containing consumer information. It is hard to imagine any business or organization that is not bound by this law.\r\n\r\nh2. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\r\n\r\nThe GLB act of 1999 mandates that financial institutions that obtain nonpublic personal information through the normal course of their business must develop precautions to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records. This includes secure storage, disposal, and sharing of confidential information. Who must comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: Banking and credit issuing, insurance, stocks, bonds, and investing, financial service providers.\r\n\r\nh2. 2009 HITECH Act\r\n\r\nA recent addition to HIPAA – the 2009 HITECH Act – requires another layer of business scrutiny. The HITECH Act requires affected institutions to alert compromised individuals and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information. The regulation defines unsecured as health information as that which is not secured by use of technology or methodology to render it unusable, unreadable, or undecipherable to unauthorized viewers.\r\n\r\nh2. The Red Flags Rule \r\n\r\nAlthough enacted in 2008, the rule has been revised and the compliance finish line has been moved. The current finish line is January 1, 2011. The Red Flags Rule is a U.S. federal law that requires most businesses and organization to develop and implement an identity theft prevention program. Authentication is required when a new financial or credit account is opened or when a change is requested on an existing covered account. The law covers consumer and business accounts. Because of the broad definitions of “covered account” and “creditor,” most businesses and organizations accept payment for products or services after they are delivered is a creditor under the law and must comply. This rule affects businesses within the healthcare, financial, utility, telecom, mortgage, auto dealerships and more. Those that only accept payment prior to or upon delivery are not creditors regardless of how payment is accepted—cash, check or credit card.\r\n\r\nh2. Sarbanes–Oxley Act\r\n\r\nThe Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 also known as SOX. The bill was enacted as a reaction to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals, which cost investors billions of dollars when the share prices of affected companies collapsed and shook public confidence in the nation\'s securities markets. The legislation set new or enhanced standards for all U.S. public company boards, management and public accounting firms. It does not apply to privately held companies. This is related to shredding in terms of records retention and the mandate to retain financial documents for at least five years past an audit or review prior to destruction. \r\n\r\nh2. Texas Shred Law 698\r\n\r\nThe Texas Information Disposal Act, House Bill 698 (HB 698), amends the Texas Business and Commerce Code adding document retention and disposal requirements. Specifically, it requires that business records containing “personal identifying information” must be shredded, erased or destroyed by other means prior to disposal. The Act took effect September 7, 2005. It applies to any and all Texas businesses that collect personal identifying information, whether it is from employees or consumers. The Act applies to all business records created before, on or after the date, which the Act took effect. The Texas Information Disposal Act addresses the final stage of the Records and Information Management (RIM) process…destruction. The Act is to ensure that any and all information that could be used to commit Identity Theft, including Social Security numbers, other government issued identification numbers, financial account numbers (credit card numbers, checking account numbers, etc.), birth-dates and email addresses are securely destroyed.',''),(3,0,'','Your Team','Texas Paper Shredding, Document Destruction Provider, Professional Team, Security Shredding','Texas paper shredding, document destruction provider, professional team, security shredding, mobile paper shredding, confidenti','Balcones Shred specializes in Texas paper shredding, document destruction provider, professional team, security shredding, mobi','!(headline)/rsrc/common/headlines/knowlove.gif!\r\n\r\nBalcones Shred is a different type of document destruction provider.

If you are visiting this site, you already suspect it’s best to retain a NAID-certified third party shredder to securely destroy confidential materials.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for more pros for your pros and cons list, this is the section for you to review closely. If you question whether or not your company can afford professional shredding, just consider the following numbers:\r\n\r\nh3. 1.) If you are a small business, your monthly shredding expenditure might be as little as $35 to $90 or less than your monthly copier or laser printer paper costs.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a medium-sized business, you’re likely to spend between $90 and $200 which is probably less than your monthly T1 phone and Internet service. Large companies will definitely spend more on security personnel and systems than secured shredding which is equally important.\r\n\r\nh3. 2) Buying a new, ill-equipped desk-side shredder for business use will produce paper shreds that can be reattached with just a few minutes of determination on the part of an identity thief or corporate spy.\r\n\r\nYou may be saying to yourself, I know better than to buy a personal shredder for the quantity of documentation our company generates so we’re considering purchasing an industrial shredder. However, industrial in-house shredders, priced anywhere from $12,000 to $25,000, are in need of a three by four footprint all the way around and a dedicated employee to feed them. Additionally, maintenance, the cost to run the machinery, the space, the noise, purchasing of shred containers, and the liability may be expenses you did not originally consider.\r\n\r\nh3. 3) Companies who have taken the in-house shredding approach can probably attest to the wasteful strain of paying a full-time, benefited employee on the books for $28,000 to $40,000 annually to sit for hours shredding documentation.\r\n\r\nThis not only begs the question of financial responsibility but also how comfortable is that employee with personally carrying the federal and state burden of compliance for your company?\r\n\r\nh3. 4) The price of noncompliance can pile up based on the number of legislative violations broken.\r\n\r\nIf even one record is compromised, the fine can be as steep as $50,000. Balcones Shred is acutely aware of recent legislature such as The Red Flags Rule, FACTA, Gramm-Leech-Bliley Act, HIPAA , and Sarbanes – Oxely Act. All these laws protect Texans from one of the nation’s fastest growing crimes – identity theft. Balcones Shred is uniquely qualified to assist you in the compliance of the latest stringent guidelines for confidential data destruction. In addition to protecting consumers, these laws are also designed to protect businesses from losing millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nh3. 5) The negative advertising value for your business’ reputation if a customer’s identity is compromised due to your company’s lack of a certified document destruction plan can be anywhere from $1,000 upwards to $10,000.\r\n\r\nThose costs are only the basic costs associated with a negative online review or blog posting not to mention if the grievance was big enough to make the local nightly news or city newspaper. Balcones Shred conducts security audits that help businesses of all sizes develop destruction plans that help ward off situations that could result in negative publicity.\r\n\r\nh3. 6) Bottom-line, your business needs a great deal of liability insurance to withstand legal and legislative costs tied to mistakes pertaining to incorrectly destroyed documents.\r\n\r\nThis is our business. Balcones Shred comes to every job backed by $10 million in liability insurance. Look behind that insurance level, and you’ll also find NAID certification. \r\n',''),(9,0,'','Why Shred','Dallas Document Destruction Services, Texas Secure Document Shredding, Austin Confidential Shredding, Why Shred','Dallas document destruction services, Texas secure document shredding, Austin confidential shredding, high security shredder, o','Balcones Shred specializes in Dallas document destruction services, Texas secure document shredding, Austin confidential shredd','!(headline)/rsrc/common/headlines/whyshred.gif!\r\n\r\nh2. To Protect Against Identity Theft\r\n\r\n!(right)/rsrc/whyshred/containers_small2.gif! According to the Federal Trade Commission, as many as nine million Americans have their identities stolen each year. Current FBI estimates find identity theft is costing American businesses and consumers $50 billion annually. When you consider the \"cost of professional shredding\":/budget.php against the cost of not shredding, the math will always lead back to third-party shredding. \r\n\r\nh2. To Obey Laws Mandating Shredding\r\n\r\nIn addition to the cost of rebuilding credit and reputation related to identity theft, there is also the pressing consideration of legal exposure to your company. More than 40 federal laws mandate that all businesses, healthcare facilities and financial institutions protect the confidential information of their clientele. All of these laws to some degree require secure document destruction that only high-grade, third party shredders such as Balcones Shred can offer. We implore you to learn more about the \"legal compliance\":/compliance.php of shredding.  \r\n\r\nh2. To Preserve Customer, Client and Patient Privacy\r\n\r\nWhether you are a two-person shop or a company known worldwide, you have confidential customer information within your possession. Today’s customer or patient comes to you for your expertise and has an unspoken expectation that you are protecting their privacy behind the scenes. Failure to do so can expose you to bad publicity, poor word of mouth and potentially lost business. Balcones Shred knows the ins and outs of all current privacy legislation including but not limited to FACTA, HIPAA, Hi-tech HIPAA, GLB, Red Flag Rules, SOX and Texas Bill 698. \r\n\r\nh2. To Shield Sensitive Company Information\r\n\r\nBeyond identity theft, there is also the threat of corporate competitors interested in the details of your confidential business papers. They are potentially looking to seize any opportunity that may be readily available in a trash or recycling dumpster. This is why Balcones Shred conducts security audits to help you identify how confidential information may be slipping through the cracks of your operation.

As a further indication of our commitment to helping our customers with in their pursuit of environmental stewardship, Balcones Shred conducts waste audits to measure how your business is doing in terms of conservation of resources. For small businesses desiring a solution for premium recycling needs such as bottles and cans, Balcones Shred provides hexagonal recycling units. \r\n\r\nA major and growing need for businesses of all sizes is electronic waste recycling. Balcones Shred provides electronic waste recycling in line with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s guidelines. Electronic waste or E-waste, as it is commonly known, is the name for electronic products nearing the end of their \"useful life.\" Computers, copiers, digital cameras, fax machines and phones are the most common business types of e-waste. Household e-waste includes televisions, VCRs and stereos. \r\n\r\nThe nonprofit Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition reports that 70 percent of the heavy metals in the nation’s landfills are from electronics. Nearly 2 in 10 consumers that disposed of a desktop computer, monitor or cell phone in the past year threw them in the trash. Fourteen percent of those that disposed of a laptop computer last year threw it in the trash. The EPA reports that Americans trash two million tons of unwanted electronics each year, which represents six times the amount they recycle. All of this E-waste being inappropriately disposed of has the potential to leak hazardous substances such as lead, cadmium, beryllium and other contaminants into surrounding ecosystems. \r\n\r\nMany electronic products can be reused, refurbished or recycled but most users do not know how. In fact, E-waste is one of the fastest growing segments of our nation\'s waste stream. Certain components of some electronic products contain materials that render them hazardous, depending on their condition and density. For this reason, Balcones Shred urges all businesses to seek out our services for the proper and compliant method for E-waste destruction and recycling.

Why do I need to shred my documents?\r\n\r\nReason #1: \r\nFirst of all, It Is the law. Secondly, it is essential for your company to protect its interests.\r\n\r\nReason #2: \r\nSome organizations are required to destroy certain kinds of information. Currently, healthcare and financial services companies are mandated to comply with certain regulations set forth by HIPAA andFACTA. If ignored, organizations can face stiff financial penalties and hinder their reputation. Since September 2005, Texas House Bill No. 698 went into effect “relating to the disposal of certain business records that contain personal identifying information; providing a civil penalty.”\r\n\r\nReason #3: \r\nYour employees have a legal right to the protection of their personal information. Any information with regard to health insurance, payroll, applications and résumés should be protected.\r\n\r\nReason #4: \r\nYour customers entrust you with important information, and it is your company’s responsibility to protect their privacy and identity.\r\n\r\n\r\nReason #5:\r\nBy discarding sensitive information in a sloppy way, you surrender ownership of that information. Shredding is the only way to make sure sensitive information is destroyed while you still maintain control of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. What is Sarbanes Oxley?\r\n\r\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, also known as the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002 and commonly called SOx or SarbOx, is a federal law passed in response to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals. These scandals resulted in a decline of public trust in accounting and reporting practices. The legislation is wide ranging and establishes new or enhanced standards for all U.S. public company Boards, Management and public accounting firms. The Act covers issues such as auditor independence, corporate governance and enhanced financial disclosure.\r\n\r\nAmong the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s major provisions in one that includes a requirement that public companies evaluate and disclose the effectiveness of their internal controls. This particular requirement emphasizes the need for companies to have detailed information control systems – including secure disposal of obsolete business records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. What is HIPAA?\r\n\r\n“HIPAA” or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, establishes national standards to protect individuals’ medical records and other personal health information.\r\n\r\n* It gives patients more control over their health information.\r\n* It sets boundaries on the use and release of health records.\r\n* It establishes appropriate safeguards that health care providers and others must achieve to protect the privacy of health information.\r\n* It holds violators accountable, with civil and criminal penalties that can be imposed if they violate patients’ privacy rights.\r\n* It strikes a balance when public responsibility supports disclosure of some forms of data – for example, to protect public health.\r\n* For patients – it means being able to make informed choices when seeking care and reimbursement for care based on how personal health information may be used.\r\n\r\n* It enables patients to find out how their information may be used, and about certain disclosures of their information that have been made.\r\n* It generally limits release of information to the minimum reasonably needed for the purpose of the disclosure.\r\n* It generally gives patients the right to examine and obtain a copy of their own health records and request corrections.\r\n* It empowers individuals to control certain uses and disclosures of their health information.\r\n\r\nFor more information about HIPPA\'s specific requirements for the average health care provider, visit the privacy plan\'s <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">site</a>.  \r\n\r\n\r\nh2. What is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act?\r\n\r\nThe Financial Modernization Act of 1999, also known as the “Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act” or GLB Act, includes provisions to protect consumers’ personal financial information held by financial institutions. There are three principal parts to the privacy requirements: the Financial Privacy Rule, Safeguards Rule and Pretexting provisions.\r\nThe GLB Act gives authority to eight federal agencies and each state to administer and enforce the Financial Privacy Rule and the Safeguards Rule. These two regulations apply to “financial institutions,” which include not only banks, securities firms, and insurance companies, but also companies providing various types of financial products and services to consumers. Among these services are lending, brokering or servicing any type of consumer loan, transferring or safeguarding money, preparing individual tax returns, providing financial advice or credit counseling, providing residential real estate settlement services, collecting consumer debts and an array of other activities. These non-traditional “financial institutions” are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Financial Privacy Rule governs the collection and disclosure of customers’ personal financial information by financial institutions. It also applies to companies, whether or not they are financial institutions, who receive such information.\r\n\r\nThe Safeguards Rule requires all financial institutions to design, implement and maintain safeguards to protect customer information. The Safeguards Rule applies not only to financial institutions that collect information from their own customers, but also to financial institutions “such as credit reporting agencies” that receive customer information from other financial institutions.\r\n\r\nThe Pretexting provisions of the GLB Act protect consumers from individuals and companies that obtain their personal financial information under false pretenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Does my state have specific requirements?\r\n\r\nAn increasing number of States and even individual cities have specific privacy legislation to protect consumers. Some of these laws specifically address privacy; others are incorporated into Deceptive Trade Practice or Credit Reporting laws. Most of this legislation requires recipients of “personal identifying information”, like Social Security Numbers, telephones numbers, names, and addresses, or some combination of that information to safeguard that information and properly dispose of it when it is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nWhile you should consult your local legal advisor on your specific requirements, it is a safe bet that some aspect of your business is affected by one privacy law or another that will necessitate shredding your end-of-life business records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. What types of document destruction services are there?\r\n\r\nDocument destruction services fall into two broad categories: “On-Site” and “Off-Site.\" These services are performed by companies ranging from the independent entrepreneur providing local service with a single truck or to large corporations with national capabilities and related services like document storage and imaging.\r\n\r\nThe type of service and company that you choose should relate to the volume of documents you have to destroy, the frequency you need service, your security policies, the flexibility and reputation of the service provider and lastly your budget. For example, very large volume purges and mixed media, like plastics, pharmaceutical bottles, and computer hard drives, don’t lend themselves well to on-site service. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. What is on-site shredding?\r\n\r\nOn-site shredding involves performing destruction services at your location in your parking lot or loading dock area. It is most frequently done with large box type trucks that contain a shredder and a mechanism for lifting a container filled with documents up into the shredding unit. These trucks make multiple stops and can typically process 10 – 20 containers an hour. Some small operations may use enclosed trailers containing a shredder instead of a dedicated truck.\r\n\r\nOn-site shredding is advantageous when you must personally witness the destruction of your documents on a regular basis. There is also no risk that whole documents might be released into the open if the truck is involved in a significant accident.\r\n\r\nDrawbacks include a potentially higher cost for the service, noise and congestion in the operating area, risk of losing documents as they are being loaded into the shred truck, and depending on the service provider, reliance on a single specialized and complicated piece of equipment. On-site shredding is also less environmentally friendly because of the extra fuel used and emissions generated by the truck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. What is off-site shredding?\r\n\r\nOff-site shredding involves transporting containers from your facility to a central shredding location. Containers are typically transported in locked vans, box trucks or even tractor trailers depending on the volume. A large off-site operation might be capable of shredding 5 to 15 tons of material an hour or twice to ten times the capability of an on-site truck.\r\n\r\nOff-site shredding is advantageous when you have a large volume of documents to be destroyed. The most common reasons for off-site shredding include: cleaning out many years of old files, if you have a large number of employees in a campus setting, or if your business is printing/processing intensive. Off-site shredding is significantly more efficient than on-site shredding because the equipment is faster and can operate continuously. Because off-site shredding is electrically powered, it makes less of an environmental impact than on-site shredding.\r\n\r\nDue to liability issues, you are not allowed to witness off-site destruction. There is also some small risk of documents being released into the open if the transport vehicle is involved in an accident between your facility and the shredding plant. ','Full Content');

It sets boundaries on the use and release of health records. It establishes appropriate safeguards that health care providers and others must achieve to protect the privacy of health information. It holds violators accountable, with civil and criminal penalties that can be imposed if they violate patients’ privacy rights. And it strikes a balance when public responsibility supports disclosure of some forms of data – for example, to protect public health. For patients – it means being able to make informed choices when seeking care and reimbursement for care based on how personal health information may be used.\r\n\r\nIt enables patients to find out how their information may be used, and about certain disclosures of their information that have been made. It generally limits release of information to the minimum reasonably needed for the purpose of the disclosure. It generally gives patients the right to examine and obtain a copy of their own health records and request corrections. It empowers individuals to control certain uses and disclosures of their health information. For the average health care provider or health plan, the Privacy Rule requires activities, such as:\r\n\r\nNotifying patients about their privacy rights and how their information can be used. Adopting and implementing privacy procedures for its practice, hospital, or plan. Training employees so that they understand the privacy procedures. Designating an individual to be responsible for seeing that the privacy procedures are adopted and followed. Securing patient records containing individually identifiable health information so that they are not readily available to those who do not need them. Responsible health care providers and businesses already take many of the kinds of steps required by the Rule to protect patients’ privacy. Covered entities of all types and sizes are required to comply with the Privacy Rule. To ease the burden of complying with the new requirements, the Privacy Rule gives needed flexibility for providers and plans to create their own privacy procedures, tailored to fit their size and needs. The scalability of the Rule provides a more efficient and appropriate means of safeguarding protected health information than would any single standard. For example,\r\n\r\nThe privacy official at a small physician practice may be the office manager, who will have other non-privacy related duties; the privacy official at a large health plan may be a full-time position, and may have the regular support and advice of a privacy staff or board. The training requirement may be satisfied by a small physician practice’s providing each new member of the workforce with a copy of its privacy policies and documenting that new members have reviewed the policies; whereas a large health plan may provide training through live instruction, video presentations, or interactive software programs.\r\n\r\nThe policies and procedures of small providers may be more limited under the Rule than those of a large hospital or health plan, based on the volume of health information maintained and the number of interactions with those within and outside of the health care system.');

That is cheaper than choosing Texas Disposal Systems, he said: $3.4 million to $4.6 million a year.\r\n\r\nThe estimates include something officials have not factored in before when talking about recycling: the cost of having city crews collect the recyclables from homes and truck them to a plant.\r\n\r\nGedert said it would cost even more — $5.7 million a year — to put the 4,500 tons of items Austin recycles each month into a landfill instead.\r\n\r\nUnder any scenario, Austin would earn a cut of the market value of the recyclables but would also have to pay processing fees and pay to collect and truck the goods to a plant. Gedert said that, weighing all of those factors, the city would lose the least money by hiring Balcones only.\r\n\r\nThe firms\' plants are in different areas , and a few council members and Mayor Lee Leffingwell asked Thursday whether it might be more efficient to split the work than to truck recyclables from the city\'s edges to just one firm\'s plant.\r\n\r\nGedert said Texas Disposal Systems has, so far, refused to accept a few key contract terms the city wants: matching lower rates and better terms that the company offers to other cities after an Austin deal is signed, and paying Austin a per-ton fee to offset carbon emissions generated by the plant and trucking materials to it. The fee would be spent on eco-friendly projects, such as planting trees.\r\n\r\nTexas Disposal Systems also has been lukewarm to the city\'s request to periodically renegotiate pricing, among other things.\r\n\r\nThe city has been searching for a recycling partner for the past few years because it doesn\'t own a plant that can process big amounts of unsorted recyclables.\r\n\r\nIt hired Greenstar North America in fall 2008 to truck the materials to the company\'s San Antonio plant and process them there. But Austin lost $2.8 million on that two -year, profit-sharing deal, partly because of a slump in the worldwide market for recyclables. (That loss didn\'t include the cost of collecting recyclables from homes.) The council asked city staffers last year to negotiate long-term deals with Balcones and Texas Disposal Systems.\r\n\r\nTexas Disposal Systems has a recycling plant in Creedmoor, south of Austin. Balcones runs a recycling facility on East Sixth Street and plans to build a bigger one on Johnny Morris Road .\r\n\r\nTexas Disposal Systems pitched different fees and profit-sharing options for the 20-year deal, offering better rates if the city sends it a larger volume of goods.\r\n\r\nBalcones has pitched a flat fee and a cut of the profits and has agreed to the city\'s other contract terms.\r\n\r\nGedert said the city would pay lower fees to Texas Disposal Systems, but it would earn more money overall with Balcones\' profit-sharing offer. It would incur the cheapest transportation costs by sending some materials to each plant, he said, because the plants will be roughly the same distance from the Todd Lane facility from which city recycling trucks depart.\r\n\r\nscoppola@statesman.com; 912-2939'),(10,'2011-07-01','Balcones Shred | Dallas Document Destruction, Paper Shredding DFW, Office Shredding DFW','customer spotlight_family place','Account Manager, Heather Shimala, talks with the Family Place','When I was asked to write an article spotlighting The Family Place I was really excited. Not because Balcones Shred is their preferred vendor or the fact that everyone that we work with at The Family Place is so kind and helpful; I wanted to make sure that everyone who reads this knows what The Family Place is and how important their services are to the community.  I went to the experts, Tina O. Hagean, the Executive Program Director and Joy Ray, their Non-Residential Operations Manager. \r\n\r\nThe Family Place opened in 1978 and provides programs for all domestic violence victims. All of the services are absolutely free and include programs such as education, intervention and crisis counseling. They also have one of the largest domestic violence shelters in the state of Texas with \"outreach programs for the entire family and the facilities are conveniently located in 4 offices across Dallas.\" They’re a safe resource for individuals who want to seek help with breaking the cycle of family violence. \r\n\r\nAll of the services they offer are FREE. Funding for their programs comes from various sources like grants, the United Way, corporate, individuals and many special events.  A victim of family violence typically finds their way to The Family Place from many avenues. This may be by a friend referring them, the police, church outreach programs, or by calling the 24-hour hotline at 214-941-1991 in Dallas or Collin counties. \r\n\r\nI have had the pleasure of working with Joy Ray since I started with Balcones Shred and had a chance to visit with her about our services. The information The Family Place handles is very confidential and must be protected. Our service offers them a simple solution to confidentially shred their secure destruction items. \r\n\r\nNot only are they required to protect their victim’s information, but also their donors.  I asked Joy what she liked about working with Balcones Shred.  She said, \"Every time I\'ve dealt with a Balcones Shred employee I am greeted by the most pleasant, professional staff and regardless of the circumstance, Balcones Shred is always able to provide exceptional service.\"\r\n\r\nIf you need additional information regarding The Family Place you can either contact me at heather@balconesshred.com or visit their website at www.familyplace.org. \r\n'),(11,'2011-07-20','Balcones Shred | Austin Document Destruction, Paper Shredding Austin, Office Shredding Dallas','Truck_Driver_Needed','Balcones Shred in Dallas needs a new Truck driver for their DFW routes.','Balcones Shred, a local document destruction company, is seeking a responsible, reliable driver for daily routes throughout DFW.

The shredders you buy\r\nat the store just don’t cut it.” The news story highlighted the fact that if you place materials in the trash or recycling bin it has the potential to end up in the hands of identity thieves or others, unless they are shredded properly.\r\n\r\nResidents and local businesses can bring their materials to be destroyed to\r\ngovernment-level standards and know that the resulting shredded paper will be recycled by Balcones and returned to good use. “The advantage of using Balcones Shred for document destruction is that your documents are being handled with the highest level of care and security as evidenced through our NAID certification. You also get the\r\nadded bonus of knowing the destroyed papers are being recycled versus dumped into a landfill,” said Matthew Hudson, Exec Vice President of Balcones Resources. “A piece of paper we shred for you at this event might end up as page in your child’s text book next\r\nfall.” \r\n\r\nThe list of items you should bring includes papers with personal information, tax returns, bank records, invoices, receipts, medial records or any paper you feel is confidential.\r\nResidents may also bring media storage devices like hard drives to be shredded. “Just because you deleted the information on the hard drive does not mean it is erased,” shared Ryan Bell, General Manager of Balcones Shred in Austin, Texas. “Many people take old hard drives and recover the data without the owner knowing – until they get a bill for online purchases they did not make.”\r\n\r\n*About Balcones Resources*\r\nBalcones Resources is the largest independent recycler and provider of comprehensive environmental services in the Southwest.
